# 43 folders

The Forty-three folders (tickler file) is a system for organizing tasks. It consists of 43-folders (surprise), 31 of which are numbered 1 through 31 and the remaining 12 are labeled with the months of the year. The system is designed as a low-budget, fairly robust task management system.

One of the primary benefits of a tickler file system is that it is not tied to any one person/device. Any member will be able to enter the makerspace and with a few easy steps identify the tasks to complete for that day.

## How it works

Initially the months are organized with *next* month's folder in front, followed by the remaining 11. The last one should be the current month, only this folder will contain tasks to completed one year from now. The numbered folders are added in front of the month folders, starting with today's date up through the last day of the month. The remaining go after next month's folder.

The start of day SOP will instruct a member to look through the day's folder and respond to any tasks contained therein. If there are previous days in front of today's date, those tasks get added to the current folder. Tasks will likely be index cards with the assignment to complete, a log to indicate who completed it, and an instruction on where to place the index card. It's also possible that one-offs or reminders are included in a particular folder. These will not need to be returned to the filing system.

On the first day of the month, all of the items in that month's folder need to be distrubuted accordingly, but don't worry, the task card will clearly indicate what needs to be done.
