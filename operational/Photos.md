# How IBiB manages photos

## Purpose

Provide a consistent workflow for managing photos of IBiB events. Note that at present, this SOP *does not* address how to manage photos for other SOPs, equipment images, or other images unrelated to candids from events.


## Context

Managing photos is a PITA - the goal is to provide a single point of entry and access to photos by administrative-level IBiB members. 

BoB currently owns the brockportoriginalbuilds gmail account. Photos are currently stored under this account. This is a standard Gmail account with a 15 GB storage limit, which will present problems in the not to distant future. 

He tried [Partner sharing](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) with another administrator. However, Google apparently believes that photo sharing should be monogamous and therefore does not allow multiple partners.

None at the moment.

## Workflow

- Photos are taken of an event
- An album is created in the brockportoriginalbuilds gmail account. 
    - Two naming methods are being used, the first (preferred) is YYMMDD-Title with YY being the two-digit year, MM the two-digit month, and DD the two-digit day. Title is whatever the title of the event is. The second method is YYYY-title for other types of multi-day events or undated photos.
- **The annoying part** BoB will create share links for the new photo albums. This will allow other users to view *and upload* photos to the album. It must be done for each album and event.
    - Because of this bottleneck, yearly photo albums are established "2023-generic". Photos can go here and as needed, moved to separate albums.

## Ideas

- Since not everyone attends every event, they won't necessarily receive an invite to an album. On the other hand, it is possible that people who don't attend an event need to access the photos, so perhaps a group of people are always invited to a shared album.
- It will quickly become annoying to organize the photo albums and remember which email contains the desired links to the album of interest.
- Consider *not using google photos* and use Google drive instead. The advantage here is that we can easily share a link to a "pictures" folder and provide read/write access. Additionally subfolders can be made using the aforementioned naming convention. (Note: Google photos does not allow for nested albums, which would mimic this feature.) 
    - We lose some of the pretty google photo interface (I use "pretty" loosely), for the benefit of only one shared link to remember.

## TODO

- Consider migration to Google Workspace, which has larger limits and potentially easier sharing options. Reasonably steep learning curve at present and annoying necessity for yet another email account for IBiB administrators.
    - The storage limit with Google Workspace is 100 TB (yep).
