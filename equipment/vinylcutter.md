# Step 1
Find the image you want to print, and import or copy/paste it into Inkscape. Draw a rectangle or ellipse around your image where you want the vinyl cutter to cut out the shape. Be sure to do this in a second layer that is "on top" of the actual image. Note the size of the boundary for your image (in units of pixels), since we'll need that in the next step. 
See the circled regions in the image below for the critical functions you'll need to use in Inkscape.

# Step 2
If your image looks like mine above, you're in good shape! We need to reduce the amount of whitespace now, so that we don't waste space on the printer. To do that, we need to set the Document Properties -> Display size to the size of our bundary (or slightly larger), as we noted in Step 1. After changing the document size, you'll probably need to move your image over to be centered on the document's whitespace. Once that's done, File -> Export your document as a PDF from Inkscape, and transfer it to the vinylcutter computer.
