# Step 1
Find the image you want to print, and import or copy/paste it into Inkscape. Draw a rectangle or ellipse around your image where you want the vinyl cutter to cut out the shape. Be sure to do this in a second layer that is "on top" of the actual image. See the circled regions in the image below for the critical functions you'll need to use in Inkscape.
