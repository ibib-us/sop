# **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**
**Xtool P2S Laser Cutter**

---

## **Purpose**
This SOP provides step-by-step instructions for safely and effectively operating the Xtool P2S laser cutter, including material selection, job setup, cutting/engraving, and post-operation cleanup.

---

## **Required Materials & Equipment**
- Xtool P2S laser cutter
- Computer with Xtool Creative Space software installed
- Approved laser-safe materials (example: 1/8" / 3 mm basswood plywood)
- Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by facility rules

---

## **Procedure**

### **1. Preparation**
1. **Power On Equipment**
   - Turn on the Xtool P2S using the **power button** on the back.
   - Launch the **Xtool Creative Space** software on the connected computer.

2. **Select Material**
   - In the upper-right corner of the software, click the material selector (default may say “Unknown Material”).
   - Choose the correct material from the list (e.g., **1/8" / 3 mm basswood plywood**).
   - If not listed, type `1/8` in the search bar to locate it.
   - Confirm that the **thickness** is correct (e.g., 3 mm).

### **2. Load Artwork**
1. **Import or Select Design**
   - Load your artwork into the workspace.
   - Use the white corner squares to resize or reposition the design on the imaged material bed.

2. **Set Vector Operations**
   - Identify elements in your artwork and assign one of the following:
     - **Cut** – Cuts completely through the material.
     - **Score** – Lightly marks the surface without cutting through.
     - **Engrave** – Burns away the surface for shading/darkness.
   - To separate elements for different operations:
     - Select **Release Compound Vector** from the right-hand panel.
     - Change line colors to distinguish between operation types (e.g., red for cut, orange for score, blue for engrave).

---

### **3. Adjust Settings**
1. **Assign Operations to Colors**
   - **Cut**: Speed ~27 mm/s, Power ~60%.
   - **Score**: Speed ~200 mm/s, Power per material default.
   - **Engrave**: Speed ~400 mm/s, Power ~15%.

2. **Verify Settings**
   - Check the **Material Processing Effects** for each color to ensure correct speed and power.

---

### **4. Run Job**
1. **Preview**
   - Review the **Settings Overview** to confirm all operations are correct.
   - Click the **green Process** button in the lower-right corner.
   - Review estimated time.

2. **Simulation (Optional)**
   - Use the **play button** in the lower-left to run a simulated preview.

3. **Start Cutting/Engraving**
   - Click **Start** in the software (upper-right corner).
   - At the machine, press the **silver button** (blue LED will be lit) to begin.
   - **Do not leave the laser cutter unattended** during operation.

---

### **5. Post-Cut Procedure**
1. **Completion**
   - After the job finishes, the exhaust fan will run for ~30 seconds.
   - You may open the lid immediately after cutting, or wait for the fan to stop.

2. **Remove Material**
   - Carefully remove the finished project.
   - Collect and dispose of any leftover scrap.
   - Clean the catch tray of debris.

3. **Repeat or Finish**
   - In software, press **OK** to exit or select **Process** again to repeat the job.

---

### **6. Shutdown & Cleanup**
1. **Save or Remove Files**
   - Delete unneeded files from the software.
   - If keeping files, store them in the **Documents** folder with your name for identification.

2. **Turn Off Equipment**
   - Close the Xtool Creative Space software.
   - Power off the Xtool P2S using the **rear power button**.

3. **Final Workspace Check**
   - Ensure all scraps are removed and placed in the designated waste bin.
   - Leave the work area clean and organized.

---

## **Safety Notes**
- Always use approved materials for laser cutting/engraving.
- Never operate the laser cutter without proper ventilation.
- Never leave the machine unattended while running.
- Follow all facility safety protocols.
