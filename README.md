# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

Here you'll find all of the (public) SOPs for the makerspace. There are various categories of SOPs which will be detailed in due course. We are presently working on operational and equipment

# SOP design guide

* SOPs are written using Restructured Text
    - See [this link](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst) for a cheatsheet
    - *Rationale*: makes it very easy to connect documents to a "read the docs" style website in the future.
    - Structure = - ^
* Resources
    - Primary SOP design guide *The Intentional Makerspace: Operations* by Grover and Root [their makerspace](www.maker-works.com)
    - Additional ideas from [here](https://www.getguru.com/templates/internal-process-standard-operating-procedure)
* Naming convention
    - SOPs are provided a unique identifier which is used as the title of the document (SOP0001.rst)
    - Images are labeled with a unique number and have the SOP ID in their name (SOP0001_I01.img) with the image indicated as I in the suffix
    - Other document types will have a one letter suffix indicator to be determined.
